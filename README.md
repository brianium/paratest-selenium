Testing PHPUnit's PHPUnit_Extensions_Selenium2TestCase With ParaTest
====================================================================

This is an example of running Selenium Web Driver tests in parallel with [ParaTest.](https://github.com/brianium/paratest)
The tests use the Chrome browser to test the Backbone.js Todo app. Running on Ubuntu 12.04
with Chrome Version 22.0.1229.79 - the results were as follows:

Vanilla PHPUnit:

![PHPUnit Selenium Results](https://raw.github.com/brianium/paratest-selenium/master/phpunit-results.jpg "PHPUnit Selenium Results")

ParaTest Results:

![ParaTest Selenium Results](https://raw.github.com/brianium/paratest-selenium/master/paratest-results.jpg "ParaTest Selenium Results")

2.25 times faster than PHPUnit alone on this test and this machine.

Setting Up
----------

### Get Selenium Server ###
You will need to make sure you have selenium server installed. Head over to [SeleniumHQ](http://seleniumhq.org/download/) and download the latest and greatest. To run the server run the jar like so:

`java -jar /path/to/selenium-server-standalone-2.25.0.jar`

### Install Dependencies Via Composer ###
All of the dependencies can be installed via composer.

`php composer.phar install`

This will install PHPUnit and ParaTest.

### Install Chrome Driver ###
These tests operate via the Chrome Driver. Installation is easy, and instructions for doing so can be found at the [Selenium wiki](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver)

Running The Tests
-----------------

To run the tests using ParaTest run the following command (will read suite from phpunix.xml):
`vendor/bin/paratest -f`

To run the tests using phpunit alone run the following command:
`vendor/bin/phpunit`

For more information on ParaTest head over to the [repo](https://github.com/brianium/paratest).
